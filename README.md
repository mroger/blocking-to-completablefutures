# Blocking code to CompletableFuture

#### Converting blocking code to asynchonous Java 8 CompletableFuture

This is a project to demonstrate to a friend how a code can be written to take advantage of CompletableFutures 
asynchronous code. But this is a dummy code with a lot of empty methods that only have code to generate delay.

Below are the relevant commits to show the conversion from blocking to asynchronous. ItÂ´s possible to see that the
first version takes longer because it's sequential.
